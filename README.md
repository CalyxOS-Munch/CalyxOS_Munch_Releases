## About -
I am building this PE rom for POCO F4 / Redmi K40s, OTA updates are working but you can always update by dirty flashing new build without wiping anything. I will try my best to keep this rom updated.
                                           
 ## Instructions to flash -
1. Have unlocked bootloader
2. adb reboot fastboot
4. fastboot flash boot boot.img
5. fastboot flash vendor_boot vendor_boot.img
6. reboot to recovery now
7. wipe data because you are changing rom
8. select adb sideload
9. adb sideload ProjectElixir_3.3_munch-xxxxxxx.zip
10. now reboot

## Instructions to update for existing PE users -
1. reboot to recovery
2. select adb sideload
3. adb sideload lineage-20.0-xxxx-UNOFFICIAL-munch.zip
